- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roy

- As a PhD student specializing in finance, my research focuses on stock market sentiment analysis.
- I am passionate about technology and have self-taught programming languages such as R, SQL, and Python, applying AI tools to financial data analysis effectively.
- In addition to my academic and technical skills,
- I am a strong communicator and writer. Outside of my professional life, I am a "child magnet" at my church, where I teach Bible school and connect with children who often see me as a favorite uncle!
- Excited to kick-start my career in the financial industry,
- I am eager to leverage my research expertise, technological enthusiasm, and interpersonal skills to contribute meaningfully to the field.
